## Who am I ðŸ’¾

Hello and welcome to my profile.

I began my career as a hospital orderly in Paris. In 2000, I set up a computer association to enable people who wanted to learn a little about their machines to learn the basics and advanced functions of their OS and software.

In 2009, I took the plunge and went back to school to become a developer.

After 3 years as a developer, my career took me into project management, where I worked for almost 10 years as a project manager, product manager and, most recently, IT manager.

In 2022, I decided to return to the technical world, in particular by learning Blockchain development and Data Analysis to bring myself up to date on development tools.

Now a Senior IT Manager, I'd like to be able to draw on my previous technical and managerial experience to take on new challenges as a Chief Technology Officer or Chief Information Officer.
