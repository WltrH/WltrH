Hi! and welcome to my profile.

I started my career as an orderly in the hospitals of Paris. In 2000, I created a computer association to allow people who wanted to learn to master their machine a little to learn the basics and advanced functions of their OS and software.

In 2009, I took the plunge and started studying again to become a developer.

After 3 years as a developer, my career led me to project management where I worked for almost 10 years as a Project Manager and lately as a Product Manager in different fields.

Since the beginning of the year 2022 I decided to come back to the world of development especially in the Blockchain and data analysis environments.

I would like to be able to combine Data and Blockchain if possible in my future job. I am convinced that these skills in these two fields, which are dear to me, will be indispensable in the near future.
